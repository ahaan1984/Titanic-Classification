# Titanic Classification
 
This project aims to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic using a Linear Regression model. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and provides information about various passengers, including features like age, gender, class, and fare paid. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

# Datasets
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, and more.

# Results
The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set. Further improvements could be explored by experimenting with more advanced algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
